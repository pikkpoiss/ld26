- You're a planetoid
- Press one button to become attracted to the nearest object
- Get too close to the object you die
- Fly into outer space you die
- Have to keep pressing gravity button to orbit objects and change trajectory
- Puzzles like flying through a corridor of objects and needing to have gravity
  at the right time to avoid obstacles
- Make it obvious visually what you'd be attracted to
- Items which don't have mass / attractiveness
